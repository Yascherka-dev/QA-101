# Chapter 1 Exercises: QA Foundations
## ISTQB Foundation Level Practice

**ISTQB Alignment:** These exercises align with ISTQB Foundation Level concepts.

## Exercise 1: Understanding QA Role

### Questions

1. **What is the difference between QA and Testing?**
   - [ ] They are the same thing
   - [ ] QA is process-oriented, Testing is activity-oriented
   - [ ] QA only does automation, Testing is manual
   - [ ] There is no difference

2. **When should QA be involved in the development process?**
   - [ ] Only at the end, before release
   - [ ] Throughout the entire SDLC
   - [ ] Only during the testing phase
   - [ ] Only when bugs are found

3. **What is "shift-left testing"? (ISTQB Principle: Early Testing)**
   - [ ] Testing only on the left side of the screen
   - [ ] Developers writing unit tests early in development
   - [ ] Testing only left-aligned elements
   - [ ] A type of automation tool

4. **According to ISTQB, which principle states that exhaustive testing is impossible?**
   - [ ] Testing shows presence of defects
   - [ ] Exhaustive testing is impossible
   - [ ] Early testing
   - [ ] Defect clustering

### Answers

1. **B** - QA is process-oriented (preventing defects), Testing is activity-oriented (finding defects)
2. **B** - QA should be involved throughout the entire SDLC, from planning to deployment (ISTQB: Early Testing principle)
3. **B** - Shift-left testing refers to developers writing unit tests early in development. For QA, we test features as soon as they're ready in the sprint (ISTQB: Early Testing principle)
4. **B** - "Exhaustive testing is impossible" is an ISTQB fundamental principle

## Exercise 2: SDLC and Scrum

### Scenario

You're in a 2-week sprint. Here's the timeline:

- **Day 1-2:** Sprint Planning
- **Day 3-8:** Development
- **Day 9-10:** Testing (planned)
- **Day 11:** Sprint Review
- **Day 12:** Retrospective

### Questions

1. **When should you start writing test cases?**
   - [ ] Day 9 (testing phase)
   - [ ] Day 1-2 (during planning)
   - [ ] Day 3 (when development starts)
   - [ ] Day 11 (during review)

2. **When should you start testing features?**
   - [ ] Day 9 (testing phase)
   - [ ] As soon as features are ready (Day 3-8)
   - [ ] Day 11 (during review)
   - [ ] After the sprint ends

3. **What should you do during Daily Standup?**
   - [ ] Only listen to developers
   - [ ] Report your testing progress and blockers
   - [ ] Stay silent unless asked
   - [ ] Only report bugs

### Answers

1. **B** - Start writing test cases during sprint planning (Day 1-2) when you review user stories
2. **B** - Test features as soon as they're ready, not wait for a "testing phase"
3. **B** - Report your testing progress, blockers, and any issues you've found

## Exercise 3: QA Responsibilities

### Scenario

You're the QA for a new feature: "User Registration"

### Task

List 5 QA activities you would perform for this feature:

1. ________________________________
2. ________________________________
3. ________________________________
4. ________________________________
5. ________________________________

### Sample Answer

1. Review user story and acceptance criteria
2. Write test cases for registration flow
3. Test registration with valid data
4. Test registration with invalid data (validation)
5. Report bugs if any issues found

## Exercise 4: Real-World Scenario

### Scenario

You're in Sprint 5, working on "User Profile Management" feature.

**Monday:** Sprint planning - You review 3 user stories about profile features.

**Tuesday:** Developer starts working on "Update Profile" feature.

**Wednesday:** Developer says the feature is ready for testing.

**Thursday:** You test and find 2 bugs.

**Friday:** Developer fixes bugs, you re-test.

### Questions

1. **What should you do on Monday?**
   - Write test cases for all 3 user stories
   - Wait until features are ready
   - Only review the stories

2. **What should you do on Wednesday?**
   - Wait until the end of sprint
   - Start testing immediately
   - Ask developer to finish all features first

3. **What should you do on Thursday?**
   - Keep bugs in a notebook
   - Create bug reports in Azure DevOps immediately
   - Tell developer verbally

4. **What should you do on Friday?**
   - Assume bugs are fixed
   - Re-test the fixed bugs
   - Test only the new fixes, skip regression

### Answers

1. **Write test cases** - Start during planning
2. **Start testing immediately** - Don't wait, test as features are ready
3. **Create bug reports immediately** - Document bugs properly
4. **Re-test the fixed bugs** - Always verify fixes, and do regression testing
