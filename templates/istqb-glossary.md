# ISTQB Glossary - Key Terms
## Foundation Level Terminology

This glossary contains key ISTQB terms used throughout this QA learning path.

---

## A

**Acceptance Testing (ISTQB)**
- Testing to verify that the system meets business/user requirements
- Performed by end-users or business stakeholders
- Final validation before production release

**Actual Result**
- What actually happens when a test is executed
- Compare with Expected Result to determine Pass/Fail

---

## B

**Boundary Value Analysis (ISTQB)**
- Test design technique that tests values at boundaries
- Example: Testing age 17, 18, 19 (boundary: 18)
- ISTQB Foundation Level technique

**Bug**
- See "Defect"

---

## C

**Component Testing**
- See "Unit Testing"
- ISTQB term for testing individual components in isolation

**Confirmation Testing**
- Re-testing after a defect has been fixed
- Also called "Re-testing" or "Regression Testing"

---

## D

**Defect (ISTQB)**
- A flaw in a component or system that can cause the component or system to fail to perform its required function
- Also called "Bug" or "Fault"

**Defect Density (ISTQB)**
- Number of defects per size unit (feature, module, lines of code)
- Formula: Total Defects / Size Unit

**Defect Detection Percentage - DDP (ISTQB)**
- Percentage of defects found during testing vs total defects
- Formula: (Defects found in testing / Total defects) × 100

**Defect Lifecycle (ISTQB)**
- States a defect goes through: New → Assigned → In Progress → Fixed → Verified → Closed

**Decision Table Testing (ISTQB)**
- Test design technique that tests all combinations of conditions
- ISTQB Foundation Level technique

---

## E

**Equivalence Partitioning (ISTQB)**
- Test design technique that groups inputs that should behave the same way
- Test one value from each partition
- ISTQB Foundation Level technique

**Error (ISTQB)**
- Human action that produces an incorrect result
- Leads to a defect

**Expected Result**
- What should happen when a test is executed
- Defined in test case before execution

**Exploratory Testing (ISTQB)**
- Unscripted testing approach
- Learn, design, execute, and report simultaneously
- Recognized by ISTQB

---

## F

**Functional Testing (ISTQB)**
- Testing that verifies the software functions correctly according to requirements
- Tests "what the system does"

---

## I

**Integration Testing (ISTQB)**
- Testing that verifies interaction between components
- ISTQB Test Level: Tests interfaces and interactions

**ISTQB**
- International Software Testing Qualifications Board
- Global certification body for software testing

---

## N

**Non-Functional Testing (ISTQB)**
- Testing of quality attributes (performance, security, usability, etc.)
- Tests "how well the system does it"

---

## P

**Priority (ISTQB)**
- Urgency to fix a defect
- Business decision
- Levels: P1 (Critical), P2 (High), P3 (Medium), P4 (Low)

---

## R

**Regression Testing (ISTQB)**
- Re-testing after changes to ensure existing functionality still works
- Part of confirmation testing

**Requirement (ISTQB)**
- Condition or capability needed by a user to solve a problem
- Basis for test cases

---

## S

**Severity (ISTQB)**
- Impact of a defect on the system/functionality
- Technical assessment
- Levels: Critical, High, Medium, Low

**State Transition Testing (ISTQB)**
- Test design technique that tests transitions between states
- ISTQB Foundation Level technique

**System Testing (ISTQB)**
- Testing the complete integrated system
- ISTQB Test Level: Tests system as a whole

---

## T

**Test Case (ISTQB)**
- Set of preconditions, inputs, actions, expected results, and postconditions
- Developed based on test conditions

**Test Condition (ISTQB)**
- Item or event that could be verified by one or more test cases
- Example: "User login with valid credentials"

**Test Design (ISTQB)**
- Process of creating test cases from test conditions
- Uses test design techniques

**Test Design Technique (ISTQB)**
- Procedure to derive test cases from test conditions
- Examples: Equivalence Partitioning, Boundary Value Analysis, Decision Tables

**Test Execution (ISTQB)**
- Process of running tests and comparing actual results with expected results

**Test Level (ISTQB)**
- Group of test activities organized and managed together
- ISTQB defines 4 levels: Component/Unit, Integration, System, Acceptance

**Test Plan (ISTQB)**
- Document describing scope, approach, resources, and schedule of testing activities
- Follows IEEE 829 standard (ISTQB reference)

**Test Type (ISTQB)**
- Group of test activities aimed at testing a component or system
- Examples: Functional, Non-Functional, Structural, Change-related

---

## U

**Unit Testing (ISTQB)**
- Testing individual components in isolation
- Also called "Component Testing" in ISTQB
- ISTQB Test Level: Lowest level of testing

**User Acceptance Testing - UAT (ISTQB)**
- See "Acceptance Testing"
- Performed by end-users before production

---

## Testing Principles (ISTQB)

**1. Testing shows presence of defects**
- Testing can show defects exist, but cannot prove they don't exist

**2. Exhaustive testing is impossible**
- Testing all combinations is not feasible
- Use test design techniques

**3. Early testing**
- Start testing early in SDLC
- Find defects when cheaper to fix

**4. Defect clustering**
- Small number of modules contain most defects
- Focus testing on critical areas

**5. Pesticide paradox**
- Repeating same tests finds fewer bugs
- Review and update tests regularly

**6. Testing is context dependent**
- Testing approaches differ by context
- Web app testing ≠ mobile app testing

**7. Absence-of-errors fallacy**
- No defects ≠ useful software
- Must meet user needs
